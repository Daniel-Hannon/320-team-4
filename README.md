## Notes on getting started and contributing
- For first time setup you'll need to run 'npm install' in the project directory in order to get all of the app's dependencies.
- Make sure you pull from the repository before you make changes
- Comment your code well so others understand what you did
- Make detailed commit messages in the proper format we discussed
  - It's better to make several small commits (focus on one thing at a time and commit it rather than make all your changes and commit that)
